# Relevance Heatmaps (deep-tayloy decomposition)

Exploring the work found at http://www.heatmapping.org/ in the context of congestion.

To run the network with a mnist data set fed in "manually":

- clone the repo
- extract the archive "mnist_csvs.zip"
- run the python script "mnist_heatmap.py"

Files relating to tfl are located in "tfl_data" for tidyness. For now, you will need to move these up to the root directory or adjust pathing.
